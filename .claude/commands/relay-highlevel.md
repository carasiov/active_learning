## Your Task

Generate a structured packet for the user to copy-paste to the high-level agent (ChatGPT).

**Symptom/Question from user:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Read the current project context from `docs/projects/decentralized_latents/channel_curriculum/CONTEXT.md`

2. Extract from CONTEXT.md:
   - Current factorization (Section 2: random variables, conditioning structure)
   - Objective structure (ELBO terms, losses, weights)
   - Component definition (what a "component" means)
   - Label integration (how supervision enters, τ-classifier)

3. Generate a markdown packet with this EXACT structure:

```
## Relay to High-Level Agent

### Current Factorization
[Generative model and inference factorization from CONTEXT.md]

### Objective Structure
[ELBO terms, losses, weights from CONTEXT.md]

### Component Definition
[What "component" means in this system - per-component latent z_k, decoder channel, mixture component]

### Label Integration
[τ-classifier mechanism, how labels steer routing]

### Symptom / Question
[The user's $ARGUMENTS, or if empty, ask what they need help with]

---
*Generated by /relay-highlevel from channel_curriculum CONTEXT.md*
```

4. Keep each section concise (3-5 lines max). The high-level agent has the full CONTEXT.md; this packet is for quick grounding.

5. If $ARGUMENTS is empty, ask the user what symptom or question they want to relay before generating.

## Output

Output ONLY the markdown packet (no preamble). Make it copy-paste ready.
