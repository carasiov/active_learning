# Session Summary: 2025-12-26

> **Purpose:** Capture session state for "Document & Clear" restart.
> **Delete after:** Next session successfully bootstraps from this.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Ran curriculum experiments** discovering the 2-channel coalition phenomenon
   - Kick diagnostic: K_eff=2.12, usage=[52%, 47%] — kick mechanism works
   - Multi-unlock (all 10 channels): K_eff=2.04 — coalition stable, channels 3-9 collapsed

2. **Analyzed results against supervisor guidance** (Dec 3 meeting)
   - Confirmed his "local minimum" prediction
   - Identified curriculum vs simultaneous training as fundamentally different optimization landscapes

3. **Created comprehensive findings document** (`FINDINGS.md`)
   - Experimental evidence, visualizations, mathematical interpretation
   - Supervisor context mapping, translation gaps
   - Next steps and questions for high-level agent

4. **Reorganized channel_curriculum documentation** (9 files → 4 active)
   - `README.md` — entry point + quick-start
   - `SPEC.md` — math, invariants, supervisor decisions
   - `IMPLEMENTATION.md` — code locations, data flow
   - `FINDINGS.md` — experimental results
   - `archive/` — historical docs (DELEGATION_V2, CONTEXT, etc.)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Curriculum ≠ simultaneous training** for inducing specialization — curriculum better suited for capacity expansion of already-specialized model

2. **Next experiment: L1 sparsity + simultaneous training** (K=20-30) — supervisor's "fast experiment" recommendation

3. **Documentation consolidation** — reduced cognitive load from ~1,500 lines to ~570 lines

---

## Current State

- **Curriculum V2:** Implemented and working (breaks single-channel monopoly)
- **Known issue:** 2-channel coalition defends against subsequent unlocks
- **Documentation:** Clean, consolidated, up-to-date
- **Next experiment:** Defined but not yet run

---

## Next Steps (for next session)

1. **Implement L1 sparsity** on channel responsibilities
2. **Run simultaneous training baseline** (K=20-30, strong L1, no curriculum)
3. **If successful:** Test hybrid approach (simultaneous → curriculum)
4. **If not:** Revisit architecture or escalate to supervisor

## Restart Command

After `/clear`, tell the new session:

```
Read these files to bootstrap:
1. docs/workflow/README.md (your role)
2. docs/workflow/SESSION_2025-12-26.md (what happened last session)
3. docs/projects/decentralized_latents/channel_curriculum/README.md (project entry point)
4. docs/projects/decentralized_latents/channel_curriculum/FINDINGS.md (current state + next steps)

Then proceed with: Implement L1 sparsity and run simultaneous training baseline experiment (K=20-30)
```
